### Adding new features

Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with us first through the
issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and possibly guide you. Coordinating up front
makes it much easier to avoid frustration later on.

If this has been discussed in an issue, make sure to mention the issue number. If not, go file an
issue about this to make sure this is a desirable change.

### Making a release

- Update the version in `metadata.json` and make a `v$version` tag
- Run `make bundle`
- Upload: https://extensions.gnome.org/upload/
